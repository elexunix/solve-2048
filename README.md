A project aiming to solve the famous 2048 game -- determine whether or not there exists a winning strategy, and what is the maximal guaranteedly achievable tile. Currently the largest solved game of this style was 3x4, its largest guaranteedly achievable tile being 64. Probably a computer cluster will be available for the 4x4 game.
